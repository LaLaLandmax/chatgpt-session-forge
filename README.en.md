# ChatGPT Session Forge

A local web app for managing Outlook-based ChatGPT login workflows and exporting usable session credentials.

It can import Outlook accounts, fetch OpenAI verification codes through IMAP or Microsoft Graph, run batch ChatGPT login jobs with configurable concurrency, and export successful sessions as CPA, sub2api, or Cockpit-compatible JSON.

## Features

- Outlook account import in `email----password----clientId----refreshToken` format
- Dual mailbox fetching with IMAP and Microsoft Graph
- External mailbox providers: Cloudflare Temp Email and Cloud Mail
- Batch ChatGPT login with configurable concurrency
- Live login status and log stream through SSE
- Account status tracking, including deactivated account detection
- CPA export as one JSON file per account
- sub2api export in grouped JSON format
- Cockpit export as a flat Codex token JSON array accepted by `cockpit-tools`
- CPA warehouse: scan CLIProxyAPI 401 credentials, relogin for fresh CPA JSON, and delete deactivated accounts
- Session converter for raw `https://chatgpt.com/api/auth/session` JSON
- Optional outbound proxy support through environment variables or Windows proxy auto-detection

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- Outlook account OAuth data:
  - email
  - password
  - Microsoft OAuth client ID
  - refresh token
- Optional self-hosted Cloudflare Temp Email / Cloud Mail API
- Network access to:
  - `chatgpt.com`
  - `auth.openai.com`
  - `outlook.office365.com`
  - `graph.microsoft.com`

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The default port is `3000`. You can override it:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PORT = "8080"
npm start
```

## Proxy

The backend uses `undici` for outbound requests. Proxy selection is controlled by `config.js`.

By default, the app tries to read the current Windows user proxy:

```js
proxy: process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || process.env.HTTP_PROXY || process.env.ALL_PROXY || 'auto'
```

You can also set it manually:

```bash
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7897 npm start
```

Use `direct` or `none` in `config.js` to disable proxy handling.

## Usage

1. Open the web UI.
2. Click "Batch Import Mailboxes" on the mailbox tab. Outlook is the default format:

   ```text
   user@outlook.com----password----client-id----refresh-token
   ```

   If verification emails are received through a self-hosted Cloudflare Temp Email or Cloud Mail service, select that provider at the top of the import modal and fill in the visible configuration fields. The app appends the provider config during import and stores the settings in the local browser.

   You can also append a provider manually:

   ```text
   user@example.com----password----client-id----refresh-token----cloudflare-temp-mail----baseUrl=https://mail.example.com;adminAuth=your-admin-auth
   user@example.com----password----client-id----refresh-token----cloud-mail----baseUrl=https://mail.example.com;token=your-token
   ```

   `providerConfig` also accepts JSON:

   ```text
   user@example.com----password----client-id----refresh-token----cloud-mail----{"baseUrl":"https://mail.example.com","adminEmail":"admin@example.com","adminPassword":"password"}
   ```

3. Go to the auto-login tab.
4. Select accounts and choose a concurrency value.
5. Start login.
6. After login succeeds, select successful accounts and export:
   - `CPA`: one JSON file per account
   - `sub2api`: grouped JSON with an `accounts` array
   - `Cockpit`: one JSON array file importable by [jlcodes99/cockpit-tools](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools)

## CPA Export

CPA export is intentionally written as one account per JSON file. The exported object uses this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "codex",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "account_id": "00000000-0000-4000-9000-000000000000",
  "chatgpt_account_id": "00000000-0000-4000-9000-000000000000",
  "plan_type": "free",
  "chatgpt_plan_type": "free",
  "id_token": "header.payload.",
  "access_token": "real-access-token",
  "refresh_token": "",
  "session_token": "real-session-token",
  "last_refresh": "2026-05-24T00:00:00.000Z",
  "expired": "2026-08-22T00:00:00.000Z",
  "disabled": false,
  "id_token_synthetic": true
}
```

The app derives this from the ChatGPT web session response and the access token claims. It does not log out after a successful login, because logging out can invalidate the access token.

## sub2api Export

sub2api export creates a grouped file:

```json
{
  "exported_at": "2026-05-24T00:00:00.000Z",
  "proxies": [],
  "accounts": []
}
```

Each account includes OAuth credentials, account ID, user ID, plan type, expiry, and metadata.

## Cockpit Export

Cockpit export uses the flat Codex token JSON array supported by the current `cockpit-tools` importer:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "codex",
    "auth_mode": "oauth",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "user@example.com",
    "account_id": "00000000-0000-4000-9000-000000000000",
    "organization_id": "",
    "user_id": "user-example",
    "plan_type": "free",
    "id_token": "header.payload.",
    "access_token": "real-access-token",
    "refresh_token": "",
    "session_token": "real-session-token",
    "last_refresh": "2026-05-24T00:00:00.000Z",
    "expired": "2026-08-22T00:00:00.000Z",
    "source": "chatgpt_session_forge",
    "id_token_synthetic": true
  }
]
```

`cockpit-tools` reads `id_token`, `access_token`, and `account_id`. When `refresh_token` is empty, it can fall back to `session_token`.

## CPA Warehouse

The CPA warehouse tab talks directly to the CLIProxyAPI management API. Flow:

```text
scan CPA auth-files
→ find 401 credentials
→ relogin the matching local account
→ success: generate and upload fresh CPA JSON
→ deactivated account: delete the old CPA credential
```

Required inputs:

- CPA base URL, for example `http://localhost:8317`
- management key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`

Only credentials whose `status/status_message` contains `401` or `unauthorized` are processed automatically. Other failures are skipped or reported to avoid accidental deletion.

## External Mail Providers

External mail providers only affect verification-code fetching. ChatGPT login, CPA/sub2api/Cockpit export, and CPA warehouse behavior remain the same.

The import modal includes visual configuration panels:

- Cloudflare Temp Email: `TEMP API`, `ADMIN AUTH`, `CUSTOM AUTH`, lookup mode, receiving mailbox, random subdomain, and domain refresh
- Cloud Mail: API address, admin email, admin password, and domain

Supported providers:

- `cloudflare-temp-mail`: compatible with Cloudflare Temp Email management APIs, reads `/admin/mails`, supports `adminAuth` / `customAuth`
- `cloud-mail`: compatible with Cloud Mail public APIs, reads `/api/public/emailList`, supports `token` or `adminEmail` + `adminPassword`
- `qq-mail`: reads a QQ mailbox through IMAP. This is useful for DuckDuckGo Email Protection addresses such as `user@duck.com` when Duck forwards verification mail to QQ Mail.

### Duck.com forwarded to QQ Mail

Duck.com addresses are forwarding aliases, not standalone IMAP inboxes. To log in with a Duck address and receive OpenAI verification codes through QQ Mail:

1. Enable IMAP in QQ Mail.
2. Generate a QQ Mail authorization code. Use this authorization code, not your QQ password.
3. In the import modal, choose `QQ 邮箱`.
4. Fill in your QQ mailbox address and IMAP authorization code.
5. Import the Duck login address in simple format:

   ```text
   your-duck-address@duck.com----x
   ```

The app submits the Duck address to OpenAI, waits for DuckDuckGo to forward the verification email to QQ Mail, and reads the code from `imap.qq.com:993` over SSL.

The provider compatibility layer references the Cloudflare Temp Email / Cloud Mail API patterns from [FoundZiGu/GuJumpgate](https://github.com/FoundZiGu/GuJumpgate). This project only adds verification-mail compatibility, not GuJumpgate's repository automation.

## Data Storage

Runtime account data is stored locally in:

```text
data/accounts.json
```

Logs are stored in:

```text
logs/
```

Both paths are ignored by Git.

## Security Notes

This project handles highly sensitive data:

- Outlook passwords
- OAuth refresh tokens
- ChatGPT access tokens
- ChatGPT session tokens
- exported CPA/sub2api/Cockpit credential files

Do not commit runtime data, logs, exported JSON, exported ZIP files, or screenshots that contain tokens. The included `.gitignore` excludes the common sensitive paths, but review `git status` before pushing.

Recommended check before publishing:

```bash
git status --ignored
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm start
```

Starts the Express server.

```bash
